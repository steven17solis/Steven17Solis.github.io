# Generating Telemetry

In this lab I'll be simulating a attack on a VM to test and identify detection capabilities. 

For this lab we will be using a Windows VM with Wazuh installed and Invoke-Atomic to simulate an attack. 

Also, I'll be using certain tools in Kali Linux to generate more telemetry.
