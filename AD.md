# Active Directory Lab

In this project I'll be deploying an Active Directory lab environment for future training and projects with SnapLabs. 

Before deploying the lab we need to create an AWS account. For more information go to the following page. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-AWSsignup.html


## Snap Labs 

Snap Labs is an online platform that builds and manages lab environments.
