# ELK

ELK is the combination of the following technologies:

E - Elasticsearch

L - Logstash

K - Kibana

These technologies provide a dynamic solution when it comes to working with large data sets. They can also be used to setup SIEM rules which would enable defenders to conduct threat hunting and detect attacks.
